# ‚õìÔ∏èüè† Tokenized Marketplace


üèõÔ∏è A decentralized platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and enabling lending-based co-ownership. Built on Hedera with Scaffold-ETH 2, this marketplace lets you mint NFTs for physical assets, lend HBAR to earn fractional ownership, and manage your digital portfolio with full transparency and compliance.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with the Tokenized Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tokenized_marketplace
yarn install
```

2. Run a local Hardhat network in the first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys the four main smart contracts (`AssetNFT`, `LendingToken`, `AssetLendingLink`, and `Marketplace`) to the local network. The contracts are located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and the deploy script is in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contracts using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract tests with `yarn hardhat:test`
